 * The set of functions ported to the portable `ctx.db` contract.

 * hosted Convex (via convex/lib/portable.ts) and on the local runtimes (via the
 * PortableRuntime in src/lib/staticConvex.ts), instead of being hand-mirrored.
 * Add an entry as each handler is ported; delete its static-mirror case once the
 * conformance test is green.
